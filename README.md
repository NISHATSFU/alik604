-  ⏳ I’m currently
    - 🔭 Working on: Machine Learning for {Cyber Security, Natural Language Processing, BioMedical Imaging, Finance} 
    - 🌱 Learning: Neural Networks - Attension, Transformers, Bayesian 
    - 🤔 I’m looking for help with: [MNIST Brain](https://github.com/alik604/MNIST_Brain), Multi dimensional EEG signal classfication
- 💬 Let's discuss: Whether one should risk their 'professional imagine' to enforce best practices and ["The maxim of manner"](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html)
    - 😡 Something I hate: When someone refers you to their paper, which provides minimal information and delegates to another paper.
- ⚡ Famous People whom I look up to: Khabib Nurmagomedov, George hotz, Elon Musk, Ian Goodfellow, Ben Goertzel
